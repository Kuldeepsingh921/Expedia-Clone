        Book a flight using an airline credit
      </label>
      <div class="answers">
        <p>If you’ve had to cancel or change your non-refundable flight, most airlines will offer you a credit instead of a refund. Here’s the things you should know.

            Using your flight credit issued due to COVID-19
            First, you will need to have the itinerary number, credit amount, and traveler name(s) handy to get started. Your flight credit can be used immediately. Currently, the only option to redeem a flight credit for future use, is by calling us. Given the high demand, we are prioritizing work on online solutions. We look forward to providing you an update here soon.  
            
            COVID-19 flight credit rules:
            The airlines are setting the policies for how you can redeem your airline credit.
            Each airline credit is in the original traveler’s name.
             Airline credits cannot be combined or transferred to another person.
            Airline credits must be used for air travel, including taxes and fees, with the airline that originally issued the ticket.  
            Airline credits cannot be used for ancillary services.
            Airline credit comes with a travel-by date (sometimes called credit validity), so be sure to factor that into your planning. As soon as we confirm your credit validity date with our partner, we will communicate it to you via email.
            For travel originally scheduled between March 19th and April 30th, we confirmed with our airline partner, that any applicable change fees would be waived.
            Not affected by COVID-19? Here's the scoop on using your flight credit
            Airline credit comes with a travel-by date, so be sure to factor that into your planning. (See your cancellation email for your specific ticket policies and details.)
            Airlines give separate credits to each traveler; you won’t be able to combine or transfer credits.
            This credit can be used only by the person whose name is on the ticket, and only with the airline that provided the credit.
            Your new flight must depart from the same country as was shown on your original ticket.
            If you choose a different destination when booking with an airline credit, some taxes may be forfeited, and new ones introduced. Bear in mind that this can impact the amount of your flight credit and how you can use it.
            All details of your airline credit, such as traveler name, credit amount, ticket number and expiration date, are in your confirmation email.
            
            How using your flight credit works
            Find an eligible flight.
            Find your original itinerary number and airline confirmation code in your flight confirmation email.
            Call us. At this time, flight credits can only be redeemed over the phone. A friendly agent will help you with your booking.
            Good to know
            If your new flight costs more than your airline credit amount, you must pay any remaining difference.
            If your new flight costs less than your airline credit amount, you could potentially forfeit the remaining value depending on the airline policy.
            To redeem an airline credit from a low-cost airline, contact the airline directly. </p>

        Private host’ listings
      </label>
      <div class="answers">
        <p>When you browse our European Union (EU) websites and book a property that’s located in the EU/European Economic Area (EEA), it may be provided by a professional host (this is generally the case) or it may be provided by a private host.

            If you have a professional host, that means it’s their job to offer properties for booking — it’s part of their trade, business, or profession.
            
            If the property has told us they are a ‘private host,’ that means they’re offering a property for booking, but it’s not something they do as a trade, business, or profession. These kinds of properties are not subject to the same EU consumer protection rules that apply to professional hosts.
            
            ‘Private host’ properties are marked with a badge on their description page. Unbadged properties are provided by a professional host. </p>

      </label>
      <div class="answers">
        <p>If you find an issue with your booking or have multiple itineraries for the same trip, you may be able to change or cancel your booking, most often online.

            To change or cancel your booking online
            Go to your itinerary page.
            Locate the manage booking section in your itinerary.
            Select the Change or Cancel link and follow the instructions.
            If you cannot change or cancel online
            If you cannot locate the Change or Cancel link in your itinerary, or cannot successfully complete the change or cancellation online, this usually means:
            Your booking is not changeable or cancellable.
            OR
            
            Your booking cannot be changed or cancelled online.
            Please contact us for assistance.
            
            Good to know
            Some changes or cancellations are subject to fees. See Change or cancellation fees for details.
            Some bookings are non-refundable. If you cancel a non-refundable booking, you will not receive a refund. See Refund process and timelines for details.
            Prior to initiating a change or cancellation, please review the detailed rules and restrictions in your itinerary.
            If you have difficulties finding your itinerary, please read View or find your booking.
            If you don't check in during your hotel's check-in hours, or never show up without canceling first, the hotel may charge you a no-show penalty fee. This fee can vary, so check the Rules and restrictions in your itinerary for your hotel's policies.
